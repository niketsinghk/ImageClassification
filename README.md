Image Classification is a fundamental task in computer vision that involves identifying and categorizing objects, scenes, or features within an image.
The goal is to assign a label (or category) to an entire image based on its visual content.
Key Concepts of Image Classification:
Input: An image (e.g., JPEG, PNG).
Output: A label or category (e.g., “cat”, “car”, “tumor”, “mountain”).

Data Preparation:

Collect and label a large dataset of images.

Preprocess images (resize, normalize, augment).

Model Training:

A machine learning or deep learning model (often a Convolutional Neural Network – CNN) is trained on labeled images.

The model learns patterns and features that distinguish different classes.

Prediction:

The trained model receives a new image.

It outputs probabilities for each class.

The class with the highest probability is selected as the prediction.

Applications:
 
Medical: Classifying diseases from X-rays, MRIs.

Security: Face recognition, surveillance.

Retail: Product categorization.

Agriculture: Detecting plant diseases.

Autonomous Vehicles: Road sign recognition.
